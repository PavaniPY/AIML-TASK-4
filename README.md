# AIML-TASK-4
Task 4: Logistic Regression

Objective : To build a binary classification model using Logistic Regression on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

Dataset Name :  Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

Steps Followed :
. Loaded dataset from local .csv file 
. Split data into training and testing sets 
. Standardized features using StandardScaler
. Trained a Logistic Regression model on the scaled data
. Evaluated performance with:
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
ROC Curve and AUC Score

Tools Used :
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Seaborn & Matplotlib
